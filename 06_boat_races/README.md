# Day 6: Boat races
The ferry brings us accross Island Island, but unfortunately this is not
where the sand is at. That is most probably at Desert Island. Lucky for us
there is a grand prize with a trip to Desert Island. The only thing we need
to do is win a boat race!

## Puzzle 1 - possible wins
The boats are actually toy boats and can be operated with a button. Pushing
the button longer increases the velocity but this also decreases the time
it can travel. We need to find the possible settings in which we would win
the current fastest time. 

## Puzzle 2 - calculate large single possibility
Maybe this puzzle should have been similar to day one in that it is a bit too
large for a single computer to calculate but it was no match for my computer
and the code was even easier than the previous one.

I am actually quite glad that this puzzle was not as hard as yesterday :-)
