# Day 12: Hot springs
Finally, we reached the hot springs! Unfortunately, we have mistaken the
onsen for the hot springs. But we are in luck, it is only a few steps
further. When entering the hot springs the next problem arises: a lava
shortage. We have to go to Gear Island to check why it has stopped flowing.
For this we are going to use one of the springy springs, but we have to 
find out which one to use and which one is safe.

## Puzzle 1 - operational and broken springs
The first part I solved by creating strings and later matching these strings.
Even for these very limited amount of patterns, it was already quite tough.
This will be a problem in puzzle 2.

## Puzzle 2 - The expansion is huge
I practically did a full rewrite, iterating over the string. This was by far
trivial and needed a hint on how to approach this.

A tough puzzle!
