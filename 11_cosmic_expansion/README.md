# Day 11: Cosmic Expansion
We come across an observatory with a helpful elf in need. As usual, we first
need to provide help before we can get some help. If we help the elf with
his galaxy problem, he will walk with us to the hot springs, the closest area
where other elfs are that could help our quest.


## Puzzle 1 - Expand galaxies and calculate distances
We get a map of the universe with shows various galaxies. To get to the
answer, we need to calculate the distance between all galaxies and sum these
up. There are however empty lines on the map which we need to expand to
twice their size. Not to difficult.

## Puzzle 2 - The expansion is huge
The expansion this time is not two but one milion. This makes the method I
used in puzzle 1 useless and I have to write it using coordinates. It is not
too difficult.
