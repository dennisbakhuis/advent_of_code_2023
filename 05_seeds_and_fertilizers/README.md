# Day 5: Seeds & Fertlizers
Of course we are again at the wrong island but we can take a ferry to the
correct place. To pass the time, we got another riddle.

## Puzzle 1 - Mapping seeds to their locations
The first part is a smart mapping exercise and I did this brute force.


## Puzzle 2 - Mapping ranges of seeds
This was actually a hard puzzle as everyone, including me, realized quite
quickly that this should not be done brute force. Instead of calculating
the value per seed, we need to work with their ranges.

This took me quite some time, including a tough fight with the Rust compiler.
