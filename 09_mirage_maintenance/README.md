# Day 9: Mirage Maintenance
We found a way out of the desert and got to an Oasis. The way to the next stop
is clearly visible, a floating island above this one but we need to wait until
the sun comes up. To kill some time, we are looking at our OASIS measurement
device.


## Puzzle 1 - Extrapolate to the right
We are given with a set of history measurements. For each set of measurements
we need to extrapolate the right values. This is done by looking at the diffs
of a each row of numbers and eventually looking at the sum to the right.

## Puzzle 2 - Extrapolate to the left
Same thing, but now extrapolate to the left. I had a small fight with the 
Rust compiler and eventual just solved it in a for loop.

Not to difficult day today.
