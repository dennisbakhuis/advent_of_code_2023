# Day 4: Scratchcards
After the gondola lift we find ourselves on island island. Unfortunately that 
is not the right island, but a very helpful elf lets us use their boat if we
help him with a small problem. He has scratchcards, a whole bunch of them. He
needs our help in getting the score.

## Puzzle 1 - calculate the score
The first part is mainly a parsing exercise, which is even quite easy as all
lines have the exact same number of values and predictable format. After the
parsing, the score is calculated using a simple power.


## Puzzle 2 - calculate the amount of scratchcards
We did not calculate the score correctly as there is no such thing as as
score. You get more scratchcards when winning. This puzzle is calculating the
total amount of scratchcards.

Due to a typo while copying the answer, I spend too much time on the first
part which was actually correct. Bummer. The second part, I probably could
optimize much more, but I was a bit fed up with it. Better luck next time :-).
