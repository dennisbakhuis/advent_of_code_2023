# Day 7: Camel cards
An airship brings us to the edge of the desert, while it should have been a
all-expenses-paid trip, it turns out to only be a five-minute one-way trip.
We are awaited by an elf that is in need of parts and takes us on the back of
his camel. As the trip takes a while, we learn a new game called camel cards.

## Puzzle 1 - total winnings
The first assignment is to calculate the total earnings. For this we need to
implement a poker variety which includes the regular things like pairs and 
full-house, but also a peculiar five-of-a-kind. Also similar ranks are
secundarily ordered by card value from left to right. While it was a bit
tedious to implement poker, the sorting itself is not too difficult.

## Puzzle 2 - add a joker
Now we make the game a bit more interesting and add a joker. While the joker
adds more possibilities for pairs and such, it has the lowest card value on
its own.

As I solve puzzle 1 quite ellaborate, puzzle 2 was not too hard.
