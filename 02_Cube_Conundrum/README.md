# Day 1: Cube Conundrum
On the second day we have met an elf with introduces us to a cube guessing
game. While I first expected some serious statistics, it was actually just
a parameter checking assignment.

## Puzzle 1 - check for possible outcomes
We are presented with a file that contains a list of games. Each game has an
id and a sequence of "GameResults". We should compare if which of these 
Games are possible when we have 12, 13, and 14 red, green, and blue cubes
respectively. For the possible cases we should sum their IDs. For this I
creates a structed and made a validator method.

## Puzzle 2 - adding "written" digits
The second puzzle is to calculate the "cube power" which are the minimum
required cubes to make all games possible. This is just a tricky name to ask
for the maximum for each color. The power is the product of the maximum for
each cube. The sum of all powers is the answer for this puzzle. As I already
made a nice structure for this puzzle, it was only a few minutes of work.

This day was not too hard! (-:
